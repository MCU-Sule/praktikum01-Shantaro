So Hard®</b></font>
 <hr>
 <h1>We'll begin with a box, and the plural is boxes,<br>
 But the plural of ox becomes oxen, not oxes.<br>
 One fowl is a goose, but two are called geese,<br>
 Yet the plural of moose should never be meese.<br>
 You may find a lone mouse or a nest full of mice,<br>
 Yet the plural of house is houses, not hice.<br>
 <h2><fontsize="5">
  If the plural of man is always called men,<br>
 Why shouldn't the plural of pan be called pen?<br>
 If I speak of my foot and show you my feet,<br>
 And I give you a boot, would a pair be called beet?<br>
 If one is a tooth and a whole set are teeth,<br>
 Why shouldn't the plural of booth be called beeth?<br>
 </h2>
 <h3><fontsize="2">
     Then one may be that, and threewould be those,<br>
 Yet hat in the plural would never be hose,<br>
 And the plural of cat is cats, not cose.<br>
 We speak of a brother and also of brethren,<br>
 But though we say mother, we never say methren.<br>
 Then the masculine pronouns are he, his and him,<br>
<s><i>But imagine the feminine: she, shis and shim!
    </s></h3></font>
